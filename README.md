# üöó Car Data Analysis ‚Äì From Raw Data to Actionable Insights

## üåü Why This Project Matters

In a **fast-paced, high-ownership environment**, data isn‚Äôt just numbers ‚Äî it‚Äôs the compass guiding product, growth, and user experience.
This project transforms raw used car data from [CarDekho](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) into **clear, actionable insights** using **SQL** for analysis and visual storytelling for decision-making.

Just like a growth/product intern role, the challenge here was:

* **Own the problem** ‚Üí Clean and structure raw data.
* **Ask the right questions** ‚Üí Which features impact price the most? How does seller type vary across fuel types?
* **Deliver insights quickly** ‚Üí SQL queries that can directly feed into dashboards.
* **Communicate findings thoughtfully** ‚Üí Present charts and summaries that empower decisions.

## üéØ Project Highlights

1. **Price Trends & Market Patterns**

   * Identified year-wise depreciation trends in selling prices.
   * Found how transmission and fuel type shift market value.
2. **User Segmentation**

   * Mapped owner category distribution to understand market composition.
   * Segmented sellers by type and correlated with fuel choice.
3. **Performance Specs Impact**

   * Compared engine capacity, mileage, and power with selling prices to find high-value car types.
4. **High-Value Vehicles**

   * Ranked the **Top 20 cars** by selling price for premium market targeting.
